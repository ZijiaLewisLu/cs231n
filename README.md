# cs231n
These are my solutions to assignments of cs231n. Weclome to discussion!

There are some cells in the notebook I didn't run, or interrupted the process, and some drafts not cleared. In general, I believe all the codes should work, as I remembered that I have corrected all of them. But I might forget some one or two stupid incorrect changes.  If you encounter them, please help me by submitting an issue!
